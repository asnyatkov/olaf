Olaf, a Sinatra-based Ruby RESTful Framework

We built Olaf for a project that didn't get off the ground, here at OnLive.
That happens.  But the framework shows a few neat properties, so we thought
we'd open-source it:

* We build nontrivially on Sinatra.  It takes a little patching, but
  it's very doable.
* We allow transparently converting between a multiprocess SOA and
  a development-friendly single-process architecture.  This makes it
  easy to develop monolithically, but test and deploy as SOA.
